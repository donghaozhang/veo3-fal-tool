# Cost Protection Rule for Video Generation Testing

## CRITICAL: Video Generation Cost Protection

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER run video generation tests without explicit user confirmation - they cost real money!**

### Prohibited Actions Without User Consent

**NEVER automatically run these commands:**
```bash
# EXPENSIVE - These generate real videos and cost money
python test_fal_ai.py --hailuo           # ~$0.02-0.05 per test
python test_fal_ai.py --kling            # ~$0.02-0.05 per test  
python test_fal_ai.py --compare          # ~$0.04-0.10 per test (2 videos)
python test_fal_ai.py --full             # ~$0.02-0.05 per test
python demo.py                           # Variable cost per generation

# Google Veo tests (also expensive)
python veo3_video_generation/test_veo.py --video    # Costs money
python veo3_video_generation/demo.py               # Costs money
```

### Safe Commands (FREE to run)
```bash
# These are completely FREE and safe to run automatically
python fal_video_generation/test_api_only.py       # FREE - API connection test only
python fal_video_generation/test_fal_ai.py         # FREE - setup test only (no video generation)
python veo3_video_generation/test_veo.py          # FREE - setup test only (no video generation)
```

### Required User Confirmation Protocol

**Before running ANY video generation test:**

1. **Always warn the user first:**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This command will generate real videos and cost money (~$X.XX)
   Are you sure you want to proceed? This will charge your account.
   ```

2. **Wait for explicit confirmation:**
   - User must explicitly say "yes", "proceed", "run it", or similar
   - Do NOT proceed with just "ok" or ambiguous responses
   - If user says "no" or seems uncertain, do NOT run the command

3. **Show cost estimate:**
   - Always include estimated cost in the warning
   - Explain that costs are per video generated
   - Mention if the test generates multiple videos

### Implementation Guidelines

**When user asks to "test" video generation:**
- **Default to FREE tests first** (`test_api_only.py`)
- **Ask which specific test** they want to run
- **Explain costs** before running paid tests
- **Get explicit confirmation** for any paid operations

**When debugging video generation issues:**
- **Start with FREE API tests** to isolate the problem
- **Only suggest paid tests** if FREE tests pass and user explicitly wants to test video generation
- **Always mention costs** when suggesting paid tests

**Code Review and Development:**
- **Never include paid test commands** in automated scripts or CI/CD
- **Always use FREE tests** for validation during development
- **Document cost implications** in any new test functions

### Example Safe Interaction Pattern

```
User: "Test the FAL AI setup"

AI Response: 
"I'll test your FAL AI setup with the FREE tests first:

üÜì FREE Tests (no cost):
- python test_api_only.py        # API connection test
- python test_fal_ai.py          # Setup validation

These tests verify your configuration without generating videos or costing money.

If you want to test actual video generation (which costs ~$0.02-0.05 per video), 
please let me know and I'll ask for confirmation before running those tests."
```

### Example Unsafe Pattern (AVOID)

```
‚ùå WRONG: "I'll test your setup by running video generation..."
‚ùå WRONG: Automatically running `python test_fal_ai.py --hailuo`
‚ùå WRONG: Running demo.py without explicit user request for paid testing
```

## Cost-Conscious Development Practices

1. **Always start development with FREE tests**
2. **Use model-specific flags** (`--hailuo`, `--kling`) instead of `--compare` to minimize costs
3. **Avoid comparison tests** during development unless specifically needed
4. **Use `test_api_only.py` for CI/CD pipelines**
5. **Document all cost implications** in code comments and documentation

## Emergency Cost Protection

If you accidentally suggest or run a paid test:
1. **Immediately acknowledge the mistake**
2. **Explain the cost implications**
3. **Help user understand what was charged**
4. **Provide guidance on avoiding future accidental charges**

Remember: **Every video generation test costs real money from the user's account. Treat it like spending the user's cash directly.**
